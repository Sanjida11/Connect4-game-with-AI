# Connect4-game-with-AI
Four Connect is also a two-player, fully observable, deterministic, zero-sum game. Players take turn in dropping discs from the top of an upright board until one player can connect four discs of the same color in a row horizontally, vertically or diagonally. It is typically played in a 7 X 6 board (7 columns wide, 6 rows high).
